# Triangle Patterns – Celebal Technologies Assessment Week 1

This Python script generates a variety of triangle patterns using loops and string formatting. It was created as part of a technical assessment for **Celebal Technologies**.

## ✨ Features

The script includes the following triangle patterns:

- 🔺 **Regular Triangle**
- 🔻 **Reverse Triangle**
- 📐 **Right-Aligned Triangle**
- 🧱 **Right-Aligned Reverse Triangle**
- 🎯 **Centered Triangle (Pyramid)**
- 🕳️ **Centered Inverted Triangle**

Each pattern is printed in a clean, structured format using a simple function-based approach.

## 🧠 Purpose

This code was developed to demonstrate:

- Loop control using `for` loops
- String manipulation and alignment
- Python function definitions and modular design
- Clean console output formatting
